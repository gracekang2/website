            <br />
            <br/>
            I have interned at <span className={this.props.LandingColour}>Wish</span> and <span className={this.props.LandingColour}>Scotiabank</span> in the past, 
            and will be heading back to Wish as a SWE intern in Winter 2021 to continue sharpening my skills.
            I am still exploring different fields of computer science, but in general, I am interested in opportunities that are both educationally challenging and exciting!

            Speaking in terms of my technical interests, I am mostly
            interested in backend development, though I have experience on the full-stack. For more
            information about my skillset or past technical experiences, you can
            head over to my skills summary or my coding experience section. Other than math and computer science, 
            I love to take electives in subjects like English and psychology. One of my favorite courses that I've 
            taken in university is an English course on modernist literature!
